### This is the code from Reply code challenge 2023

(simplified basic code from 2022 with plain JS/NodeJS)

- team the code we produced during the challenge
- marcel, 2nd try on that problem
- chatgpt
  - I tried to ask chatGPT https://platform.openai.com/playground for a solution with the content in chatgpt.md

  - it gave me a proper solution within chat promt and js code
  - output script is chatgpt.js (but not working / giving a score output)



Run Code with

`node index.js`
